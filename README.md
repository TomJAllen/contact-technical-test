<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Contact are a company that allows creatives to manage their career and put them in direct contact with clients through the use of their platform. 

As part of my application to work at Contact, I was asked to build a programme that had two criteria:

1. It accepts a JSON array of talent, containing objects with `name`, `location` and `date_of_birth` attributes
2. A user is able to filter by location, producing an output of the talent in that locatio

I developed this programme to fulfil these criteria.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The setup expects the following tools to be installed on the system.

Github
Ruby 2.4.0
Rails 5.0.2


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:organization/project-name.git

2. Create and setup the database
As the data file is hardocded in, you can just run the following commands to create and setup the database.

rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed

3. Start the Rails server
You can start the rails server using the command given below.

And now you can visit the site with the URL http://localhost:3000

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This was a timeboxed exercise therefore the current usage fulfils the minimum brief. At this stage, the user can search any location and, if the searched location exists, they will be presented with a list of the available talent. The search is case insensitive.
