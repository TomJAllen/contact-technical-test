<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Contact are a company that allows creatives to manage their career and put them in direct contact with clients through the use of their platform. 

As part of my application to work at Contact, I was asked to build a programme that had two criteria:

1. It accepts a JSON array of talent, containing objects with `name`, `location` and `date_of_birth` attributes
2. A user is able to filter by location, producing an output of the talent in that locatio

I developed this programme to fulfil these criteria.
